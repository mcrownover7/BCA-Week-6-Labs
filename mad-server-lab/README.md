The purpose of this lab is to get more comfortable reading form data on the server. In this lab we will be creating a Madlibs style game where we will ask the user for a few words, and then enter them into a story when the final word has been submitted; using forms! We will be setting up dynamic routes to ask the user for words in sequence until we have enough words to fill out our story.
